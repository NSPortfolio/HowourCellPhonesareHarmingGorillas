In fact, a 2010 UN report predicted that gorillas would decimate around large strips of land in the Congo Basin. The extinction of primates could hinder scientific research on evolution as studying species sharing about 98.3% of human DNA could unlock many mysteries of our evolutionary history.</p>

           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> The peril is largely due to modern threats such as chemical pollution. Coltan, an ore found in many of our favorite devices such as our smartphones, is mined in rivers using very little technology. However, it is not the mine that poses threats to gorillas. The extraction of this ore is done for a cheap price, and money is saved in food costs as well. Therefore, miners are expected to hunt to eat and end up killing endangered apes. </p></td>
